**RayTTT** is a classic TicTacToe game built in C++ using
[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). It rocks a clean neon retro style with
bright colors and smooth animations that make the game fun and easy on the
eyes.

The gameplay is simple and intuitive -- perfect for a quick solo match or a
friendly challenge against a buddy. It keeps track of wins and draws so you can
see who's really winning the friendly rivalry.

It runs smoothly on Windows, Linux, and macOS, so no matter what system you’re
on, you’re good to go.

Plus, the code is neat and beginner-friendly, making it a great starting point
if you want to learn game dev with raylib and C++ or just tinker around.
